# dotfiles
These are my global configuration files. They are mostly setting up 
 * zsh + oh-my-zsh
 * tmux
 * vim
 
 For zsh, it uses the package manager [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen). For vim is uses [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
 
To install, just go to the root of this folder and run
```
./install 
```
